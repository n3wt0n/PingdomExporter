### Examples
```bash
feat: add support for custom API endpoints
fix: handle network timeout errors gracefully
docs: update installation instructions
style: fix code formatting in ApiService
refactor: extract common HTTP client logic
test: add unit tests for export service
ci: add automated security scanning
```

### Breaking Changes
For breaking changes, add `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer or add `!` after the type:
```bash
feat!: remove deprecated configuration options

BREAKING CHANGE: The old configuration format is no longer supported
```

## Code Guidelines

### .NET Conventions
- Follow standard C# naming conventions (PascalCase for classes, camelCase for variables)
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Add XML documentation comments for public APIs
- Use `async/await` for asynchronous operations
- Handle exceptions appropriately

### Project Structure
```
PingdomExporter/
â”œâ”€â”€ Models/          # Data models and DTOs
â”œâ”€â”€ Services/        # Business logic and API services
â”œâ”€â”€ Program.cs       # Application entry point
â””â”€â”€ appsettings.json # Configuration
```

### Code Style
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Place opening braces on new lines
- Use `var` when type is obvious from context
- Keep methods focused and single-purpose
- Add comments for complex business logic

### Error Handling
- Use appropriate exception types
- Log errors with sufficient context
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Don't swallow exceptions silently

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive unit tests to ensure code quality and reliability. When contributing:

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run tests with detailed output
dotnet test --logger "console;verbosity=detailed"

# Run tests for a specific project
dotnet test PingdomExporter.Tests
```

### Test Requirements
When adding new features or fixing bugs:

1. **Write tests for new functionality** - All new features should include corresponding unit tests
2. **Update existing tests** - If you modify existing functionality, update the relevant tests
3. **Ensure all tests pass** - Your changes should not break existing tests
4. **Test edge cases** - Consider error scenarios, null values, and boundary conditions
5. **Mock external dependencies** - Use mocking for API calls and external services

### Test Organization
The test project follows a clear structure:

- **`Models/`** - Tests for data models, JSON serialization, and validation
- **`Services/`** - Tests for business logic and service classes
- **`ProgramTests.cs`** - Integration tests for dependency injection and configuration

### Test Guidelines
- Use descriptive test method names that explain what is being tested
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Each test should focus on a single behavior
- Use `[Theory]` and `[InlineData]` for parameterized tests
- Mock external dependencies to ensure tests are isolated and fast

### Test Coverage Areas
- **CLI Argument Parsing** - All command-line options and validation
- **Data Models** - JSON serialization, property validation, edge cases
- **Configuration** - Default values, validation, multiple sources
- **Integration** - Dependency injection, service resolution, HTTP client setup

### Manual Testing
For features that interact with the Pingdom API:

1. Test with valid Pingdom API credentials
2. Verify cross-platform compatibility
3. Test error scenarios (invalid tokens, network issues)
4. Validate output files and formats

### Adding New Tests
When adding tests for new functionality:

1. Place tests in the appropriate directory (`Models/`, `Services/`, etc.)
2. Follow existing naming conventions
3. Include tests for both success and failure scenarios
4. Document complex test scenarios with comments

## Continuous Integration

The project uses GitHub Actions for automated testing and code coverage reporting:

### Test Automation
- **Automated Testing**: All tests run automatically on every push and pull request
- **Cross-Platform Testing**: Tests run on Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS for pull requests
- **Test Results**: Detailed test results are published as GitHub Actions artifacts
- **Coverage Reports**: Code coverage is automatically calculated and reported

### Coverage Reporting
- **Coverage Collection**: Uses XPlat Code Coverage to collect coverage data
- **Report Generation**: ReportGenerator creates HTML and Cobertura reports
- **Codecov Integration**: Coverage reports are uploaded to Codecov (requires `CODECOV_TOKEN` secret)
- **PR Comments**: Coverage information is automatically commented on pull requests
- **Minimum Coverage**: Currently set to 75% (configurable in workflow)

### Artifacts and Reports
- **Test Results**: Available as downloadable artifacts for 30 days
- **Coverage Reports**: HTML coverage reports available as artifacts
- **Cross-Platform Builds**: Platform-specific builds created for releases

### Setting Up Coverage Integration
To enable full coverage reporting:

1. **Codecov Setup** (optional):
   - Sign up at [codecov.io](https://codecov.io)
   - Add your repository
   - Add `CODECOV_TOKEN` to repository secrets

2. **Local Coverage Testing**:
   ```bash
   # Run tests with coverage locally
   dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
   
   # Install ReportGenerator globally
   dotnet tool install -g dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool
   
   # Generate HTML report
   reportgenerator -reports:"**/coverage.cobertura.xml" -targetdir:"CoverageReport" -reporttypes:Html
   ```

### Coverage Targets
- **Minimum Coverage**: 75% overall
- **New Code**: Should maintain or improve coverage
- **Critical Paths**: CLI parsing, API integration, and export functionality should have high coverage
- **Test Categories**: All test categories should be well-covered

## Documentation

- Update README.md if you're changing functionality
- Add or update code comments for complex logic
- Update PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md if you're changing the project organization
- Include examples in your documentation

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update your fork** with the latest changes from main:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull upstream main
   git checkout your-feature-branch
   git rebase main
   ```

2. **Ensure your code follows the guidelines** above

3. **Create a pull request** with:
   - Clear title following conventional commit format
   - Detailed description of changes
   - Reference to any related issues
   - Screenshots or examples if applicable

4. **Respond to feedback** and make requested changes

5. **Squash commits** if requested to maintain clean history

## Release Process

Releases are automated through GitHub Actions:

1. **Merge to main** triggers the release workflow
2. **Semantic versioning** determines the next version based on commit messages
3. **Cross-platform builds** are created automatically
4. **GitHub release** is published with downloadable assets
5. **CHANGELOG.md** is updated automatically

You don't need to manually manage versions or releases.

## Issue Reporting

When reporting issues:

1. **Search existing issues** to avoid duplicates
2. **Use issue templates** if available
3. **Provide clear reproduction steps**
4. **Include relevant configuration** (without API tokens)
5. **Specify your environment** (OS, .NET version, etc.)

## Feature Requests
